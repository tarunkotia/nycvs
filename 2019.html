                            Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a world epidemic affecting over 110 million people and resulting in over 8.9 million deaths. It makes up 15.9% of all death making it the most common cause of death in the world. In the United States 20% of those over 65 have CAD. Likewise, Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) affects 155 million people worldwide. In 2015 it was responsible for over 52,500 deaths up from 16,000 deaths
                            in 1990. It carries a greater than 20% risk of a coronary event in 10 years and a 5-year mortality rate of 30%. The New York Coronary and Vascular Summit is organized in conjunction with Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center faculty from the section of Cardiology. Guest faculty includes national and international though leaders in the field of Interventional Cardiology, Vascular Surgery and Interventional Radiology.

                            <h1>Conference Goals and Overview</h1>
                            The primary focus of this course is to present a multidisciplinary approach to revascularization of patients with complex coronary, and peripheral vascular disease. The critical role of percutaneous left ventricular support (Impella, Impella CP, Pecutaneous Heart Pump, R-Pella, ECMO), in supporting complex interventions will be discussed and emphasized on the case by case basis. Various interventional devices and techniques such as orbital atherectomy (OA), rotational atherectomy, laser atherectomy, and complex peripheral vascular intervention will be emphasized. Technical issues regarding retrograde CTO techniques both in coronary & peripheral cases, unprotected left main disease, heavily calcified lesions, bifurcation lesions,
                            total occlusions, thrombotic lesions, recurrent in-stent restenosis, carotid stenting, and pedal access for complex critical limb ischemia interventions will be discussed by the faculty using live case presentations as platforms using the live case format. Treatment of emerging problems, appropriateness of revascularization and evidence-based practice guidelines will be discussed while live cases are performed. Within the live case format, current topics will be presented to provide interventional cardiologists and vascular interventionalists with state-of-the-art information for managing patients as the dynamic field of interventional cardiology and endovascular intervention continues to evolve.

He has treated patients in some of the nation’s top hospitals and underserved communities, and he has also served as a Army doctor overseas in hospitals and on the battlefield, treating  soldiers and military personnel during wartime missions. A strong supporter of community service and improved public health, Dr. Wiley uses his medical knowledge military service, government experience and management skills to improve the delivery of critical medical services to the disadvantaged and underprivileged both here in America and worldwide. He has received numerous awards, decorations and recognition for his achievements in surgical treatments, medical breakthroughs and healthcare management</p>" +
     "<p>He embarked on this mission in his native Puerto Rico, where he completed medical school at the Universidad Central del Caribe, Bayamon in June 1994.  That same year, he joined the United States Army Reserve and quickly rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.  Two years later he moved to New Orleans and completed a residency in internal medicine in 1998, followed by a fellowship in cardiology in 2001 at the Tulane University School of Medicine. As a chief cardiology fellow, Dr. Wiley was awarded with the Albert Hyman “Fellow of the Year” award in 2001. During that time, he also published an epidemiologic study of cardiovascular disease in Hispanics living in New Orleans, which was published and presented at the Southern Medical Society annual meeting in 1999, and won an honorific mention. For his extensive service in New Orleans, Dr. Wiley was recognized in 1999 by Mayor Marc Morial, Jr., who awarded him with an Honorary Citizenship for his volunteer medical services to the city’s Hispanic population. He completed his education in New Orleans with an interventional cardiology fellowship at the Ochsner Clinic Foundation in June 2002.</p>" +    
    "<p>It was in the Dakotas where Dr. Wiley acquired extensive surgical and management experience in the medical field.  At St. Alexius Medical Center in Bismarck, North Dakota, he developed a robust endovascular and structural heart disease program. In 2008, he was the first physician in the state to non-surgically close an atrial septal defect (the hole between the two upper chambers of the heart) and the first in western North Dakota to perform a carotid stent procedure with embolic protection which protects patients from having strokes.  His development of an endovascular research program in the region attracted industry-sponsored clinical trials as well as multi-centric National Institute of Health (NIH) research. Dr. Wiley was the primary site investigator for the NIH-sponsored Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions trial, which focused on outcomes for renal artery stenting </p>" +
    "<p>Then Dr. Wiley moved to New York City to join The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, with a dual academic appointment of assistant professor in its Medicine-Cardiology and Radiology departments.  He was named Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory of North General Hospital, a Mount Sinai Hospital-supported laboratory, from 2008 to 2010, and Associate Director of Endovascular Interventions at Mount Sinai Hospital’s Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory from 2008 to 2015.  Dr. Wiley was also a co-director of Mount Sinai’s annual Live Symposium of Complex Coronary & Vascular Cases, as well as for its Endovascular Live Webcasts, a Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Cardiovascular Institute-supported program in association with the American College of Cardiology.</p>"+ 
    "<p>During that time, Dr. Wiley was re-activated by the Army to serve with the 56 HHC Brigade, 28th Infantry Division, in Iraq, where he was awarded with the Army Commendation Medal for his extraordinary services as a field surgeon in the battlefield. </p" +
    "<p>In 2015, Dr. Wiley moved to Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City as its Director of Endovascular Interventions in the Center for Heart & Vascular Care.  He is also an Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</p>" +
    "<p>Dr. Wiley regularly goes outside the Bronx hospital to serve the underserved community who surround it. In 2010, he was elected to the governing board of Casa Promesa, a community-based organization in the Bronx that serves its Latino population through education, housing, employment opportunities and drug treatment programs, and houses a 108-bed, long-term care facility for AIDS patients. He is also a Staff Cardiologist at Urban Health Plan, Inc., a diagnostic and treatment center that is in its 40th year of providing comprehensive and affordable primary healthcare services to neighborhoods in the Bronx. He is also the founder and President of the Gift Project for Global Cardiovascular Health (GIVE), a non-for-profit organization (501c3) to improve global cardiovascular health by fostering partnership among major academic medical centers, business, governments, non-governmental organizations and private citizens. GIVE provides free care to patients with complex cardiac and vascular diseases as well as education to caregivers in developing countries.</p>" +
    "<p>Dr. Wiley earned board certifications and licenses to practice medicine, including the American Board of Internal Medicine Certification in Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Diseases and Interventional Cardiology; American Board of Vascular Medicine in Endovascular Medicine; and Medical Licenses with the states of New York and Louisiana.  Dr. Wiley was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in 2008, a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology in 2008, and a Fellow of the American College of Physicians in 2009. </p>" +
    "<p>As a leader in the endovascular field, Dr. Wiley has been invited to speak at medical conferences across the nationwide and worldwide. In the U.S., he has given numerous Grand Rounds at academic institutions, including Mount Sinai-Elmhurst, North General Hospital, and Richmond University Medical Center in New York City, and the University of North Dakota School of Medicine.  He has lectured  as a guest faculty for the American Heart Association’s annual scientific meeting (2015); the Congreso Nacional de Cardiologia (in Mendoza, Argentina (2014); Sociedad Latinoamericana de Cardiologia Intervencional in Buenos Aires, the largest interventional cardiology meeting in Latin America (2014); Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, the largest interventional cardiology meeting in the world (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015); the American College of Cardiology’s annual scientific meeting, the largest cardiology meeting in the world (2012, 2013 and 2014); Congreso Innovaciones en Cardiologia y Medicine Vascular in Monterrey, Mexico (2011); the Puerto Rican Society of Cardiology congress (2011); and the Honduran Cardiology Association Annual Symposium (2005 and 2006).  He is currently an investigator in numerous clinical research protocols, and has published in multiple peer-reviewed medical journals including Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology The Journal of the American College of Cardiology JACC Cardiovascular Interventions, Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions, and Cardiovascular Pathology. Dr. Wiley has also authored several book chapters in major cardiovascular texts.</p>" +
    "<p>One of his proudest achievements came in 2012: being awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor on May 12.  This is one of the highest civilian awards given in the U.S to immigrants for their contributions to the nation’s achievements; and recipients are officially recognized and read into the Congressional Record.  On August 16, the New York League of Puerto Rican Women gave Dr. Wiley the “Man of the Year” award for his contributions to the Hispanic population of New York, and on the same day, he also received a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition for his outstanding achievements by Congressman Tim Bishop,   Along with his professional duties and community service, Dr. Wiley took the time to add one more achievement to his long and extinguished career: He completed a Masters degree in Public Health, focused on Health Policy and Management, at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health in the fall of 2014.";
