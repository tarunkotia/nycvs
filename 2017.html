                            Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a world epidemic affecting over 110 million people and resulting in over 8.9 million deaths. It makes up 15.9% of all death making it the most common cause of death in the world. In the United States 20% of those over 65 have CAD. Likewise, Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) affects 155 million people worldwide. In 2015 it was responsible for over 52,500 deaths up from 16,000 deaths
                            in 1990. It carries a greater than 20% risk of a coronary event in 10 years and a 5-year mortality rate of 30%. The New York Coronary and Vascular Summit is organized in conjunction with Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center faculty from the section of Cardiology. Guest faculty includes national and international though leaders in the field of Interventional Cardiology, Vascular Surgery and Interventional Radiology.

                            <h1>Conference Goals and Overview</h1>
                            The primary focus of this course is to present a multidisciplinary approach to revascularization of patients with complex coronary, and peripheral vascular disease. The critical role of percutaneous left ventricular support (Impella, Impella CP, Pecutaneous Heart Pump, R-Pella, ECMO), in supporting complex interventions will be discussed and emphasized on the case by case basis. Various interventional devices and techniques such as orbital atherectomy (OA), rotational atherectomy, laser atherectomy, and complex peripheral vascular intervention will be emphasized. Technical issues regarding retrograde CTO techniques both in coronary & peripheral cases, unprotected left main disease, heavily calcified lesions, bifurcation lesions,
                            total occlusions, thrombotic lesions, recurrent in-stent restenosis, carotid stenting, and pedal access for complex critical limb ischemia interventions will be discussed by the faculty using live case presentations as platforms using the live case format. Treatment of emerging problems, appropriateness of revascularization and evidence-based practice guidelines will be discussed while live cases are performed. Within the live case format, current topics will be presented to provide interventional cardiologists and vascular interventionalists with state-of-the-art information for managing patients as the dynamic field of interventional cardiology and endovascular intervention continues to evolve.

    "<p>It was in the Dakotas where Dr. Wiley acquired extensive surgical and management experience in the medical field.  At St. Alexius Medical Center in Bismarck, North Dakota, he developed a robust endovascular and structural heart disease program. In 2008, he was the first physician in the state to non-surgically close an atrial septal defect (the hole between the two upper chambers of the heart) and the first in western North Dakota to perform a carotid stent procedure with embolic protection which protects patients from having strokes.  His development of an endovascular research program in the region attracted industry-sponsored clinical trials as well as multi-centric National Institute of Health (NIH) research. Dr. Wiley was the primary site investigator for the NIH-sponsored Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions trial, which focused on outcomes for renal artery stenting </p>" +
